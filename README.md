# Furniture Sales Overview- Excel Project
# Project Background 


A U.S.-based furniture retailer was facing challenges with understanding product performance, regional sales trends, and shipping efficiency. Business decisions were often based on static reports, making it difficult to identify growth opportunities or address operational issues.

To support data-driven decision-making, this project analyzed historical furniture sales data to uncover key insights on:

- Product and category performance
- Shipping cost and delivery trends
- Regional sales patterns
- Profitability across segments
