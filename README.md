# Furniture Sales Overview- Excel Project
# Project Background 


A U.S.-based furniture retailer was facing challenges with understanding product performance, regional sales trends, and shipping efficiency. Business decisions were often based on static reports, making it difficult to identify growth opportunities or address operational issues.

To support data-driven decision-making, this project analyzed historical furniture sales data to uncover key insights on:

- Product and category performance
- Shipping cost and delivery trends
- Regional sales patterns
- Profitability across segments
# Executive Summary 
### Overview of Findings 

Sales peaked in December at $47.4K, highlighting strong year-end demand.
Chairs led all products with $328.4K in total sales, showing high customer interest.
Standard Class accounted for 59% of orders, but most deliveries still took 4 days.
Despite an 8% sales increase, profit dropped 57%, signaling pricing or cost issues. 
# Implementation
I loade the data in Microsoft Excel and cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and formatting data types. I created pivot tables and pivot charts in Excel to analyze sales, profit, quantity, and shipping trends across product categories and regions.![view](https://github.com/ARAFAH-LAWAL102/Data-Analytics/blob/main/PIVOT%20TABLE.pngThen)

After which, I built a fully interactive dashboard with dynamic KPI cards, trend charts, map visualizations, and slicers to allow users to filter by region and customer segment. The dashboard was designed to present key business insights in a clear, visual, and easy-to-use format.
