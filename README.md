# Furniture Sales Overview- Excel Project
The goal of this project was to analyze furniture sales data in order to identify performance trends, uncover key business insights, and present them in a visual and interactive format that helps stakeholders make informed decisions about pricing, shipping, product focus, and regional strategy.

Implementation

I imported and cleaned the dataset using Power Query, handling missing values and formatting fields. I used pivot tables and pivot charts in Excel to analyze sales, profit, quantity, and shipping trends across product categories and regions. Then, I built a fully interactive dashboard with dynamic KPI cards, trend charts, map visualizations, and slicers to allow users to filter by region and customer segment. The dashboard was designed to present key business insights in a clear, visual, and easy-to-use format.

 Key Metrics displayed on the dashboard includes:

i) Total Sales – Overall revenue generated from furniture sales

ii) Total Profit – Earnings after cost of goods and expenses

iii) Quantity Sold – Total number of items sold

iv) Year-over-Year (YoY) Change – Growth or decline compared to the previous year

v) Monthly Sales Trends – Identifies high-performing and low-performing months

vi) Shipping Mode Usage – Distribution across Standard, First Class, etc.

vii) Delivery Duration – Number of days it took for orders to be delivered

viii) Top Categories and Products – Performance by product type

ix) State and City Sales – Geographical distribution of sales 

# Key Insights

i) Profit decreased by 57% despite an 8% increase in sales, suggesting possible cost or pricing issues.

ii) Standard Class was the most used shipping mode, making up 59% of orders.

iii) Most orders were delivered in 4 days, showing potential to improve delivery speed. 
 
iv) Chairs had the highest sales, totaling $328.4K, indicating strong customer demand.

v) New York City led all cities in sales, followed by Seattle and San Francisco.

vi) December was the peak month for sales, suggesting a strong seasonal opportunity.

# Recommendations

i) Check pricing and cost structure to find out why profit dropped even though sales increased.

ii) Offer faster and more flexible shipping options to improve customer satisfaction. 

iii) Focus on year-end sales campaigns, since December showed the highest sales performance. 

iv) Promote popular products like chairs and furnishings to increase revenue.

v) Target low-performing states and cities to expand customer reach and grow sales.
