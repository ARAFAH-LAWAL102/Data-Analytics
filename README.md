# Furniture Sales Overview- Excel Project
# Project Background 


A U.S.-based furniture retailer was facing challenges with understanding product performance, regional sales trends, and shipping efficiency. Business decisions were often based on static reports, making it difficult to identify growth opportunities or address operational issues.
The goal of this project was to enable data-driven decision-making by analyzing historical furniture sales data to uncover insights on:

- Product & Category Performance – identify top- and low-performing products
- Shipping Cost & Delivery Trends – highlight areas for cost optimization
- Regional Sales Patterns – understand which regions drive revenue growth
- Profitability Across Segments – reveal where the business gains or loses profit

This analysis aimed to empower stakeholders with clear, interactive dashboards and actionable recommendations to improve sales strategy, optimize operations, and boost overall profitability.

# Implementation
- Data Preparation: Loaded the dataset in Microsoft Excel, cleaned missing values, standardized data types, and ensured consistent formatting.

- Analysis: Built PivotTables and PivotCharts to explore sales, profit, quantity, and shipping trends across product categories, regions, and customer segments.![view](https://github.com/ARAFAH-LAWAL102/Data-Analytics/blob/main/PIVOT%20TABLE.png)

- Dashboard Design: Created an interactive Excel dashboard featuring KPI cards, monthly trend charts, map visualizations, and slicers for region and customer segment filtering — allowing users to explore insights dynamically.
